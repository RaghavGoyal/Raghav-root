## **HANGMAN APP: Built with the power of ZIO**

This repository is based out of practice from the
guidance from one of the ZIO beginners guide.

This is a simple console based application that
simulates the game of Hangman.

The user is given a word randomly from a dictionary
created locally in the app. The player is required
to guess the word by guessing the alphabets.

Here is a catch, <BR>
The player only has 6 attempts for making an incorrect
guess. Each incorrect guess leads you closer
to a HANGMAN...

This app is developed following the pure functional
programming approach. ZIO library has helped in
achieving that.
