   * Actors hierarchy.
   * Child actors are managed by the parent actors.
   * Child actors can also have further child actors.
   *
   * Parent -> Child -> Grand child
   *        -> Child2
   * Note: The lifecycle of a child actor is tied to the parent â€“ a child can stop itself or be stopped at any time
   * but it can never outlive its parent.
   *
   * There are three kind of guardian actors. They are responsible for managing all the actors. They are:
   * 1. /system : this is a system level guardian. Every actor system has a system guardian that is responsible for
   *              managing all the operations of the actorSystem. Like logging.
   * 2. /user   : This is the user level guardian. Every actor that programmers create using system.actorOf are
   *              governed by the /user guardian, which is a top level guardian for all user actors.
   * 3. /       : Root guardian. This guardian is responsible for managing /system and /user guardians.
   *              Root guardian is the top-most level guardian for all the actors.
